## Hey! I'm Kevin

I'm building this site to document what I learn as a software engineering student and share my knowledge along the way.

## My Motivations

I have the privilege of speaking Spanish as a my native language, and I want to contribute content in Spanish as it can be challenging to find relevant software development resources in Spanish as it is in English, and I hope to help bridge that gap.
