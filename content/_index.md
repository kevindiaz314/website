## Hey! I'm Kevin

I'm building this site to document what I learn as a software engineering student and share my knowledge along the way.

## My Motivations

I have the privilege of being a native Spanish speaker, and I've noticed that the software development world is heavily English-centric. Resources, documentation, and learning materials are predominantly available in English. By creating content in Spanish, I hope to contribute to the Spanish-speaking developer community and help bridge that gap.
